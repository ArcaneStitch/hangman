# hangman

This program challenges the user to guess a word, with each wrong guess the player's life is reduced and a man starts to appear,
this game has three difficulties, and is practically impossible to beat without cheating.
There are some inappropriate words in the list as I copied the hard words without a second thought from this website, 
https://www.bestwordlist.com/7letterwordspage53.htm, and the easy and medium words from http://www.poslarchive.com/math/scrabble/lists/common-234.html.
As of now, medium is currently the easiest difficulty.
